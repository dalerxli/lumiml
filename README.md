# Installation
The easiest and cleanest way to use LumiML is to create a new Python environment.

In such new environment, please make sure to install the numpy, scikit-learn, dill and scipy.

The installation of the final required package (nlopt), will depend on the specific operating system that you use. For detailed instructions, please refer to the nlopt [homepage](https://nlopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
